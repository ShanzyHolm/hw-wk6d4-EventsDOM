Events Lab
Learning Objectives
Be able to use a variety of event listener types
Be able to access values from form inputs when on submit
Be able to attach events to a variety of DOM elements
Be able to read and write to the DOM
Brief
Your task is to create a Reading List app that allow a user to submit items they intend to read later and view them on the page. Using the start code, which has the the html and css already provided, you will need to handle the form's submission and display the submitted details on the page.

MVP
The provided html form has the following fields:

Title - text input
Author - text input
Category (e.g. book, article, blog post) - select
Once the user has submitted the form, the reading list item's details should be displayed below and the form's fields should reset to empty. Each time the user submits the form, the new reading list item should be added to the display.

Hint: Research form.reset()

Considerations
When we want to get the values from inputs that are contained within a form, we do that by handling the form's submit event, rather than handling the individual input's event separately.

Planning
Add a script tag to index.html so that the browser knows to load the JavaScript
Add behaviour to the DOM elements' events


Extensions
Add a delete all button, that clears the list of submitted reading list items.
Add flexbox layout to the reading list so that items are displayed in a responsive grid.


const handleDelete = function(event) {
    const readingList = document.querySelector("#reading-list");
    readingList.reset();
}

const handleDelete = function(event) {
    const readingList = document.querySelector("#reading-list");
    readingList.remove();
}


const handleDelete = function(event) {
    var result = confirm("Do you really want to delete this list?");
    if (result ==true){
      const readingList = document.querySelector("#reading-list");
      readingList.remove();
    }
}

const handleDelete = function(event) {
    var result = confirm("Do you really want to delete this list?");
    if (result ==true){
      var readingList = document.getElementsByClassName("book").removeChild;
      // readingList.removeChild(readingList);
    }
}
